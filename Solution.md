# Method or Algorithm Proposed for the Assigned Problem
OS Project: Sleeping Teaching Assistant using mutex locks and semaphores.
	
N threads for students :-
  
  1 thread for TA.

2.An array of 3 semaphores to signal and wait chair to wait for the TA.
	
  3.A semaphore to signal and wait for TA's next student.
